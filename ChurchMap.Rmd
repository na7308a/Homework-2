## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r churches}
library(readr)
library(knitr)
Religious_Buildings <- read_csv("~/Religious_Buildings.csv")
head (Religious_Buildings)
library(ggmap)
library (ggplot2)
geocode("Baltimore")
qmplot(lon, lat, data = df,colour = I('red'), size = I(1), darken = .3)
```
